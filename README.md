# File Manager Application for Android

## Overview
This File Manager application was developed as part of my coursework at Georgia State University. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing files on Android devices, allowing users to view, move, create, copy, and delete files. This project demonstrates my skills in Java, Android development, and user interface design.

- **File Management**: Move, create, copy, and delete files with simple and intuitive actions.
- **User Interface**: Clean and responsive UI designed for ease of use on Android devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core language for the application logic.
- **Android SDK**: Used for building the Android application.
- **Gradle**: For managing project dependencies and build automation.
